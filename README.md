# 🎵 Spotify Application Redesign: HCI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on redesigning the Spotify mobile application to enhance user experience (UX) by applying core **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** principles. The redesign shifts the focus from "Business Goals" (e.g., pushing Premium) to "User Goals" (e.g., accessing music quickly), reducing cognitive load and improving accessibility.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement
The original Spotify interface presented several usability issues identified through heuristic evaluation:
* **Misaligned Priorities:** Navigation prioritized business goals (e.g., "Premium", "Create") over frequent user actions.
* **High Cognitive Load:** Text-heavy lists in the Library made content retrieval slow and tiring.
* **Fitts’s Law Violations:** Small interaction targets (e.g., thin rows, small play buttons) increased error rates.
* **Accessibility Risks:** Dynamic backgrounds in the Profile section caused poor text contrast.
* **Lack of Context:** The Lyrics page covered playback controls, leaving users unsure of the system state.

## 🛠 Design Solutions & Improvements

### 1. Simplified Navigation
* **Change:** Replaced "Premium" and "Create" with **History** and **Profile** in the bottom bar.
* **Benefit:** Prioritizes User Frequency. The "History" tab mimics natural memory recall.

### 2. The "Now Playing" Screen
* **Change:** Enlarged the "Play" button, made it solid green, and switched to a structured dark background.
* **HCI Principle (Fitts’s Law):** Primary action is now the largest target, reducing acquisition time.

### 3. Library Redesign
* **Change:** Replaced vertical text lists with **Grid-Based Visual Cards** using large album art.
* **HCI Principle (Recognition over Recall):** Users recognize images faster than reading text. Large targets also reduce "miss-taps".

### 4. Profile & Social
* **Change:** Removed dynamic gradients for a consistent dark theme. Added prominent "Find Friend" and "Share" buttons.
* **HCI Principle (Aesthetic & Minimalist Design):** improved contrast and removed visual noise to focus on relevant data.

### 5. Lyrics & Context
* **Change:** Added a persistent "Control Card" at the bottom of the lyrics view and highlighted the active line.
* **HCI Principle (Visibility of System Status):** Users never lose access to playback controls while reading lyrics.

### 6. New Feature: History Tab
* **Change:** A dedicated section for recently played content.
* **Benefit:** Transitions the experience from "Active Retrieval" (Search) to "Passive Recognition," significantly lowering mental effort.

## 🧠 Core HCI Principles Applied

1.  **Fitts’s Law:** Optimized mobile ergonomics by enlarging primary controls (Play button, Cards) and placing them in the natural "Thumb Zone".
2.  **Recognition over Recall:** Minimized memory load by using visual cards and a History tab, allowing users to recognize content rather than recalling names.
3.  **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (Nielsen’s 8th Heuristic):** Removed clutter and utilized a structured dark theme to ensure WCAG compliance and better visual hierarchy.
4.  **Visibility of System Status:** Ensured playback controls are always visible, even on the Lyrics page.

## 📈 Conclusion
By focusing on user goals and strict HCI guidelines, this redesign achieved:
* **Reduced Cognitive Load** via visual hierarchies.
* **Improved Task Speed** via larger touch targets.
* **Better Accessibility** via high-contrast UI elements.
